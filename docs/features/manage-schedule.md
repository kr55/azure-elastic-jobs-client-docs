## Schedule Configuration Options
1.  Mark `Enabled` checkbox to enable scheduling settings for the job.
2. **Occurrence Setting**:
   - Select `Occurs Once` option if the job should execute only once.
   - Choose `Occurs Every` option to set a recurring schedule. Specify the frequency (e.g., every 3 hours) and select the time unit (Minutes/Hours/Days/Weeks/Months).
3. **Start Date & Time**:
   - Set the date and time when the job should start executing.
4. **End Date & Time Options**:
   - Choose either a specific end date and time or select `No End Date` for perpetual schedulling.

## Summary Section
- Displays a summary of your configured schedule settings, including frequency and timing details and the timezone.
