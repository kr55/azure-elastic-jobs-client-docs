# Azure Elastic Jobs Manager - Managing Job Schedule

## Overview
The **Job Schedule Management** screen in Azure Elastic Jobs allows you to configure scheduling options for your jobs. Here's how to use it effectively:

## Navigation
- **Select a Page**: Use the left sidebar to navigate between different sections: `General`, `Steps`, and `Schedule`.
- **Progress Indicator**: The progress bar indicates the current status of your configurations.

## Schedule Configuration Options
1. **Enabled Checkbox**:
   - Mark this checkbox to enable scheduling settings for the job.

2. **Occurrence Setting**:
   - **Occurs Once**: Select this option if the job should execute only once.
   - **Occurs Every**: Choose this option to set a recurring schedule. Specify the frequency (e.g., every 3 hours) and select the time unit (hours/minutes).

3. **Start Date & Time**:
   - Set the date and time when the job should start executing.

4. **End Date & Time Options**:
   - Choose either a specific end date and time or select 'No End Date' for continuous execution until manually stopped.

## Summary Section
- Displays a summary of your configured schedule settings, including frequency and timing details.

## Action Buttons
- Click **OK** to save your configurations.
- Click **Cancel** to discard any changes.

Remember to adjust these settings based on your specific job requirements! ðŸš€


# Tables

Tables are responsive by default, allowing wide tables to have a horizontal scroll to access columns outside of the normal viewport.
