**1. What has been included in the software package?**
 
You will receive an email with a download link to the product and an activation key. Once you download the zip file after the purchase, you will get an installer to install and activate the software, installation guide, and product documentation file.

**2. What payment options are available?**

We currently only accept payment via PayPal. If you do not have a PayPal account, PayPal generally offers to use a credit card without creating an account. However, this differs based on your country of origin. Check out PayPal [privacy policy](https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/privacy-full). Reach out to our support in case of any payment issues.

**3. Is there a limited feature free trial available?** 

Currently, we offer a 1-month full feature free trial. You can get it from [this](https://azureops.org/product/azure-elastic-jobs-manager/) link.

**4. How can I receive software updates?**

AzureOps offers free software updates readily available on the Visual Studio marketplace. If you installed this tool as a Visual Studio extension, these updates will be automatically shipped to you. However, if you do not have extensions, you can download the updates anytime from the marketplace.

**5. Where does the data get stored?**

Azure Elastic Jobs Manager does not collect any data through this extension as this is an on-premise tool.  It is user's choice to let the wizard remember Azure Elastic database connection credentials locally for future use.
